# Phazes

### Game Overview
  This is a platform game where the player needs to utilize "phasing" through space and time to move through levels and obstacles.
  
## Game BackGround
At the start of the universe, there are two kinds of matter, blue and red. They were always fighting each other causing chaos and destruction. After decades of struggle, they established paralleled dimensions that coexists. 
  
  At the first instance of time when Red and Blue collides, a spark from the chaos between Blue and Red created a mythical disk. The disk was then casted out of space, only stuck within the time vortex between the dimensions. It was said that the one that could utilize the disk could not only safely shift through the two parallel dimensions, but could also project itself into the near past or future.

  #### Movement
  * 'w' - jump
  
  * 'a' - left
  
  * 's' - down
  
  * 'd' - right
  
  #### Phasing
  * '/' - shift through the dimensions of blue and red
  > by shifting through the dimensions, the player could stand on or utilize different map objects with different color.
  
  #### Time Projecting
  >There is a tiny grey shadow following the player. The grey shadow will walk the path that the player had taken, thus recording the past.
  * '<' (also the ',' key) - go back in time / projecting to the past
  > by going back in time, the player will return to its position a certain amount of time ago. The amount of time will be indicated by the shadow that follows you.
  >> player will be teleported to position of the shadow
  >> after reaching the position, the player will recieve a velocity in the direction of the player to the shadow.
  >> the further the player is from the ball, the faster, vice versa
  
  * '>' (also the '.' key) - go forward in time / project your character to the future
  > by projectiong into the future, the player will teleport in the opposite way the player had traveled, indicated by the shadow.
  >> player will the teleported to a direction opposite of direction to the shadow
  >> so instead of teleporting to the shadow by projecting to the past, it teleports the player to the opposite direction
