# Phazes

### Game Overview
  This is a platform game where the player needs to utilize "phasing" through space and time to move through levels and obstacles.
  
## Game BackGround
At the start of the universe, there are two kinds of matter, blue and red. They were always fighting each other causing chaos and destruction. After decades of struggle, they established paralleled dimensions that coexists. 
  
  At the first instance of time when Red and Blue collides, a spark from the chaos between Blue and Red created a mythical disk. The disk was then casted out of space, only stuck within the time vortex between the dimensions. It was said that the one that could utilize the disk could not only safely shift through the two parallel dimensions, but could also project itself into the near past or future.
